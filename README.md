# Marginal and total exceedance probabilities of environmental contours

This is the repository for the publication 'Marginal and Total Exceedance 
Probabilities for Environmental Contours' by Ed Mackay and Andreas F. 
Haselsteiner. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marstruc.2020.102863

## Download and use the repository
To download this repository and its submodules use
```console
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/2020-note-on-contours.git
```

It holds two main Matlab scripts:
* `Example1and2.m` reproduces the analyis of the sea state examples.
* `Example3.m` reproduces the analysis of the directional design conditions example.

Further it holds three subfolder containing multiple files:
* `compute-hdc` is a software package to compute environmental contours.
* `example1and2-subfunctions` holds subfunctions for running the script Example1and2.m.
* `example3-subfunctions` holds subfunctions for running the script Example3.m.
