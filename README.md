# Marginal return levels from environmental contours

This is the repository for the publication 'Marginal and Total Exceedance 
Probabilities for Environmental Contours' by Ed Mackay and Andreas F. 
Haselsteiner.

```

It holds two main Matlab scripts:
* `Example1.m` reproduces the analyis of the sea state example.
* `Example2.m` reproduces the analysis of the directional design conditions example.

Further it holds three subfolder containing multiple files:
* `compute-hdc` is a software package to compute environmental contours.
* `example1-subfunctions` holds subfunctions for running the script Example1.m.
* `example2-subfunctions` holds subfunctions for running the script Example2.m.
